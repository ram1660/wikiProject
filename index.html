        An <b>apple</b> is an edible fruit produced by an
        <b>apple tree (Malus domestica)</b>. Apple trees are cultivated
        worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
        The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
        sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands
        of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
        European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
        significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European
        Christian tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their
        parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired
        characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal
        grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to
        be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used
        to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree,
        allowing for easier harvesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different
        cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking,
        eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a
        number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be
        controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the
        fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control
        and selective breeding in apple production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with
        China accounting for nearly half of the total.<sup><a

      <h3 class="title">Etymology</h3>
      <p>
        The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from
        the Proto-Germanic root <i>*ap(a)laz</i>, which could also mean fruit
        in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European
        *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship
        between both words[clarification needed] is uncertain. As late as the
        17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit
        other than berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle
        English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.<a><sup>[4]</sup></a>
        This use is analogous to the French language use of pomme.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
      <p>
        The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15
        ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When
        cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by
        rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately
        arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and
        slightly downy undersides.<sup>[5]</sup> Apple blossom Blossoms are
        produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and
        are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2
        in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five
        petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers.
        The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it
        opens first and can develop a larger fruit.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup><sup><a>[6]</a></sup> The fruit is a pome that
        matures in late summer
        or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial
        growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4
        in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially
        those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm
        (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh
        market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green,
        pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be
        found.<sup><a>[7]</a></sup> The skin may also be wholly or partly
        russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective
        layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale
        yellowish-white,<sup><a>[7]</a></sup> though pink, yellow or green
        exocarps also occur.<sup><a>[9]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <h4>Wild ancestors</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Main article: <a>Malus sieversii</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii,
        found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern
        Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup><sup><a>[10]</a></sup> of the
        species, most likely beginning on the
        forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long
        period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from
        other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange
        with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations
        of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more
        morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without
        recent admixture the contribution of the latter
        predominates.<sup><a>[11]</a></sup><sup><a>[12]</a></sup><sup><a>[13]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <h4>Genome</h4>
      <p>
        Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has 17
        chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb.
        Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first one
        in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.<sup><a>[14]</a></sup>
        However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain
        several errors<sup><a>[15]</a></sup> in part owing to the high degree
        of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an
        ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently,
        double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole
        genome sequences of higher quality.<sup><a>[16]</a></sup><sup><a>[17]</a></sup> The first whole genome assembly
        was estimated
        to contain around 57,000 genes,[14] though the more recent genome
        sequences support more moderate estimates between 42,000 and 44,700
        protein-coding genes.<sup><a>[16]</a></sup><sup><a>[17]</a></sup> Among other things, the availability of whole
        genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the
        cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of
        multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting
        extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following
        domestication.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <h3 class="title">History</h3>
      <p>
        Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the
        cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic
        variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the
        center of origin for apples.<sup><a>[19]</a></sup> The apple is
        thought to have been domesticated 4000–10000 years ago in the Tian
        Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to
        Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from
        Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M.
        sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing on the western side
        of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated
        apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
        Chinese soft apples, such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been
        cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2000 years in China. These
        are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in
        Kazakhstan.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup> Among the traits selected for by
        human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble
        sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild M. sieversii origin
        is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
        At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy,
        seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon
        dated to around 4000 BCE.<sup><a>[20]</a></sup> Genetic analysis has
        not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient
        apples were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus
        sieversii ancestry.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup> It is generally also hard to
        distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples
        and apple plantations. There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation
        in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial
        apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was
        certainly known then.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup> Grafting is an essential
        part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate
        the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was
        invented.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup> Winter apples, picked in late autumn
        and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia
        and Europe for millennia.<sup><a>[22]</a></sup> Of the many Old World
        plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th
        century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.<sup><a>[23]</a></sup>
        Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th
        century,<sup><a>[5]</a></sup> and the first apple orchard on the North
        American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton
        in 1625.<sup><a>[24]</a></sup> The only apples native to North America
        are crab apples, which were once called "common apples".<sup><a>[25]</a></sup>
        Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native
        American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms.
        An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best"
        cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars
        by the early 19th century.<sup><a>[25]</a></sup> In the 20th century,
        irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the
        development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the
        apple is the leading product.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup> Until the 20th
        century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter
        for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples
        by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.<sup><a>[26]</a></sup><sup><a>[27]</a></sup> Controlled
        atmosphere facilities are used to
        keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use
        high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to
        maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in
        the 1960s.<sup><a>[28]</a></sup>
