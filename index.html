          An <b>apple</b> is an edible fruit produced by an
          <b>apple tree (Malus domestica)</b>. Apple trees are cultivated
          worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
          The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus
          sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands
          of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
          European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological
          significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European
          Christian tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their
          parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired
          characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal
          grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to
          be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used
          to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree,
          allowing for easier harvesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different
          cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking,
          eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a
          number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be
          controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the
          fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control
          and selective breeding in apple production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with
          China accounting for nearly half of the total.<sup><a

        <h2 class="title" id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          The word apple, formerly spelled æppel in Old English, is derived from
          the Proto-Germanic root <i>*ap(a)laz</i>, which could also mean fruit
          in general. This is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European
          *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship
          between both words[clarification needed] is uncertain. As late as the
          17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit
          other than berries but including nuts—such as the 14th century Middle
          English word appel of paradis, meaning a banana.<a><sup>[4]</sup></a>
          This use is analogous to the French language use of pomme.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title" id="Description">Description</h2>
        <p>
          The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15
          ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When
          cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by
          rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately
          arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and
          slightly downy undersides.<sup>[5]</sup> Apple blossom Blossoms are
          produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and
          are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2
          in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five
          petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers.
          The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it
          opens first and can develop a larger fruit.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup><sup><a>[6]</a></sup> The fruit is a pome that
          matures in late summer
          or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial
          growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4
          in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially
          those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm
          (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh
          market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green,
          pink, or russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be
          found.<sup><a>[7]</a></sup> The skin may also be wholly or partly
          russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective
          layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale
          yellowish-white,<sup><a>[7]</a></sup> though pink, yellow or green
          exocarps also occur.<sup><a>[9]</a></sup>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Wild ancestors</h3>
        <p>
        <div class="off-topic-info">Main article: Malus sieversii</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii,
          found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern
          Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup><sup><a>[10]</a></sup> of the
          species, most likely beginning on the
          forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long
          period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from
          other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange
          with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations
          of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more
          morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without
          recent admixture the contribution of the latter
          predominates.<sup><a>[11]</a></sup><sup><a>[12]</a></sup><sup><a>[13]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Genome</h3>
        <p>
          Apple is diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), has 17
          chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb.
          Several whole genome sequences have been made available, the first one
          in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.<sup><a>[14]</a></sup>
          However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain
          several errors<sup><a>[15]</a></sup> in part owing to the high degree
          of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an
          ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently,
          double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole
          genome sequences of higher quality.<sup><a>[16]</a></sup><sup><a>[17]</a></sup> The first whole genome
          assembly
          was estimated
          to contain around 57,000 genes,[14] though the more recent genome
          sequences support more moderate estimates between 42,000 and 44,700
          protein-coding genes.<sup><a>[16]</a></sup><sup><a>[17]</a></sup> Among other things, the availability of
          whole
          genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the
          cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of
          multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting
          extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following
          domestication.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2 class="title">History</h2>
          <p>
            Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the
            cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic
            variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the
            center of origin for apples.<sup><a>[19]</a></sup> The apple is
            thought to have been domesticated 4000–10000 years ago in the Tian
            Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to
            Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from
            Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M.
            sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing on the western side
            of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated
            apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Chinese soft apples, such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been
            cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2000 years in China. These
            are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in
            Kazakhstan.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the traits selected for by
            human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble
            sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild M. sieversii origin
            is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.<sup><a>[18]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy,
            seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon
            dated to around 4000 BCE.<sup><a>[20]</a></sup> Genetic analysis has
            not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient
            apples were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus
            sieversii ancestry.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup> It is generally also hard to
            distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples
            and apple plantations.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation
            in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial
            apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was
            certainly known then.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup> Grafting is an essential
            part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate
            the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was
            invented.<sup><a>[21]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Winter apples, picked in late autumn
            and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia
            and Europe for millennia.<sup><a>[22]</a></sup> Of the many Old World
            plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th
            century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.<sup><a>[23]</a></sup>
            Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th
            century,<sup><a>[5]</a></sup> and the first apple orchard on the North
            American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton
            in 1625.<sup><a>[24]</a></sup> The only apples native to North America
            are crab apples, which were once called "common apples".<sup><a>[25]</a></sup>
            Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native
            American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms.
            An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best"
            cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars
            by the early 19th century.<sup><a>[25]</a></sup> In the 20th century,
            irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the
            development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the
            apple is the leading product.<sup><a>[5]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Until the 20th
            century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter
            for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples
            by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.<sup><a>[26]</a></sup><sup><a>[27]</a></sup> Controlled
            atmosphere facilities are used to
            keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use
            high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to
            maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in
            the 1960s.<sup><a>[28]</a></sup>

            <h3 class="sub-title">Germanic paganism</h3>
            <p>
              In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by
              Snorri
              Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R.
              Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism
              developed.
              She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and
              nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in
              the
              early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have
              had
              a
              symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.[29]
            </p>
            <p>
              Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in
              Norse
              mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir,
              who
              was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál. Davidson also
              notes
              a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga:
              when
              the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger
              (in
              the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.[30] Rerir's wife's consumption of
              the
              apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by Caesarean section) of their son—the hero
              Völsung.[31]
            </p>
            <p>
              Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of Hel" used in an 11th-century poem by the
              skald
              Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of
              the
              dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with
              apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the
              apple
              in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near
              East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson
              concludes
              that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess
              of
              the life-giving fruit of the other world."[29]

            <h3 class="sub-title">Greek mythology</h3>
            <p>
              Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems
              identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word "apple" was used as a generic
              term
              for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[32] For
              instance,
              in
              Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the
              Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its
              center.[33][34][35]
            </p>
            <p>
              The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus
              and
              Thetis.[36] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes
              transliterated
              Kallisti, "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera,
              Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both
              Hera
              and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded
              the
              apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[37]
            </p>
            <p>
              The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to
              symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of
              that
              love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[38]
            </p>
            <p>
              I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but
              if
              your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.
              — Plato, Epigram VII
            </p>
            <p>
              Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all
              but
              Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon, the Greek word for both "apple"
              and
              fruit in general),[34] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a
              fair
              race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It
              took
              all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and
              Atalanta's
              hand.[33]

            <p>
              Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition
              has
              held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[39] The origin of the popular
              identification
              with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in confusion between the Latin words
              mālum
              (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[40] The tree of the forbidden
              fruit
              is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17,[41] and the Latin for "good and
              evil"
              is bonum et malum.[42]
            </p>
            <p>
              Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of
              Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge,
              immortality,
              temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the
              "Adam's apple" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of
              Adam.[39] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an
              ironic vein.[39]

            <p>
              The proverb, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit,
              has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and
              you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".[43] In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved
              to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away"; the phrasing now
              commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[44] Despite the proverb, there is no evidence that eating an
              apple daily has any significant health effects.[45]

          <h2 class="title">Cultivars</h2>
          <div class="off-topic-info"> Main article: <a>List of apple cultivars</a></div>
          <p>
            There are more than 7,500 known cultivars (cultivated varieties) of apples.[46] Cultivars vary in their
            yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.[47] Different cultivars are
            available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the
            responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over
            2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.[48] The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing
            the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of
            Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are
            38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.[49]
          </p>
          <p>
            The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of
            many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same "genetic" apple cultivar. Most of
            these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for
            cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat
            fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.[50]
          </p>
          <p>
            Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial
            apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high
            yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[47] Modern apples are generally
            sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and
            Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following.[51] Extremely sweet
            apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[51] especially the Indian subcontinent.[50]
          </p>
          <p>
            Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them
            to have better flavor than modern cultivars,[52] but they may have other problems that make them
            commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just
            being the "wrong" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been
            preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally
            important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have
            sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old
            cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though
            by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.[5]

            <p>
              Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be
              propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is
              because seedling apples are an example of "extreme heterozygotes", in that rather than inheriting genes
              from
              their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly
              different
              from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.[53] Triploid cultivars have an additional
              reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding
              unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a
              seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[54]
            </p>
            <p>
              Because apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds, although cuttings can take root and breed
              true,
              and may live for a century, grafting is usually used. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can
              be
              selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect
              and
              disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce
              very
              small trees (less than 3.0 m or 10 ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life
              cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.[55] Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced
              as
              far back as 300 BCE, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple
              trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through
              several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.[56] The majority of the rootstocks used
              today
              to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station
              conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and today their rootstocks are given an "M" prefix to
              designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an "MM" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed
              with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.[57]
            </p>
            <p>
              Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately
              crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.[58] The words "seedling", "pippin", and "kernel" in the
              name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports
              (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar.
              Some
              differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.[59]
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady
              progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists,
              throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is
              the
              most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.
            </p>

              Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed
              factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.[60]

            <h3 class="sub-title">Pollination</h3>
            <div class="off-topic-info">See also: <a>Fruit tree pollination</a></div>
            <p>
              Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each
              season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used.
              Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are
              sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.[59][61]
            </p>
            <p>There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('Gravenstein', 'Red Astrachan')</li>
              <li>Group B – 4 to 7 May ('Idared', 'McIntosh')</li>
              <li>Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('Granny Smith', 'Cox's Orange Pippin')</li>
              <li>Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('Golden Delicious', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')</li>
              <li>Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('Braeburn', 'Reinette d'Orléans')</li>
              <li>Group F – 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')</li>
              <li>Group H – 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' – also called Court-Pendu plat)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with
              B, but not A with C or D).[62]</p>
            <p>Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with
              pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period. </p>

            <p>Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.
              Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more
              difficult. Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees
              typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440 lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor
              years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees
              grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10–80 kg (20–180 lb) of fruit per year.[59]</p>
            <p>Farms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples.[63]</p>
            <p>Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in
              the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', 'Sweet Bough', and
              'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango',
              'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny

            <h3 class="sub-title">Storage</h3>
            <p>Commercially, apples can be stored for a few months in controlled atmosphere chambers to delay
              ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon
              dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and
              preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. </p>
            <p>For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the
              coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5 °C). Some can be stored up to a year without significant
              degradation.[dubious – discuss][64][verification needed] Some varieties of apples (e.g. 'Granny Smith' and
              'Fuji') have more than three times the storage life of others.[65]</p>
            <p>Non-organic apples may be sprayed with a substance 1-methylcyclopropene blocking the apples' ethylene
              receptors, temporarily preventing them from ripening.[66] </p>

            <div class="off-topic-info">See also: <a>List of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus</a></div>
            <p>A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are
              mildew, aphids, and apple scab. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers,
                normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be
                treated similarly to Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the
                infected plants are among recommended actions.[67]
              </li>
              <li>
                Aphids are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple
                aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by
                color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).[67]
                Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high
                numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.[68]
              </li>
              <li>
                Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn
                brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar
                brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple
                leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.[69]
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Among the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called fireblight, and two fungal
              diseases: Gymnosporangium rust and black spot.[68] Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling
              moths and apple maggots. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed
              on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.[69] The larvae of the apple clearwing moth
              (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing
              significant damage.[70]</p>
